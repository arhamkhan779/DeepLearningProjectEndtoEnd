# Tumor Detection Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for tumor detection using advanced machine learning techniques. The project is designed to facilitate easy updates and configurations for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical imaging.

## Workflows

To effectively manage and update the project, follow these steps:

1. **Update `config.yaml`**: Modify the main configuration settings for the project.
2. **Update `secrets.yaml` (Optional)**: If your project requires sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, update this file accordingly.
3. **Update `params.yaml`**: Adjust the parameters used in the model training and evaluation processes.
4. **Update the Entity**: Make changes to the data entity definitions if needed.
5. **Update the Configuration Manager**: Navigate to `src/config` and make necessary updates to the configuration manager to reflect your changes.
6. **Update the Components**: Modify any components of the pipeline that may require updates based on the new configurations or entities.
7. **Update the Pipeline**: Ensure that the pipeline scripts are in sync with your changes.
8. **Update `main.py`**: Implement the main execution script to reflect any modifications made to the configurations or pipeline.
9. **Update `dvc.yaml`**: If you're using DVC (Data Version Control), update this file to manage your data dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tumor-detection-project.git
